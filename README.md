# LLM Model Behavior Research: Understanding AI Decision-Making Patterns

**Author**: Kalyani Khona | **Research Period**: 2024-2025 | **Last Updated**: August 2025  
**Focus**: Large Language Model behavior analysis, Generative Engine Optimization (GEO), and AI-human interaction patterns

## Research Overview

This repository contains **applied behavioral research** on how Large Language Models behave, interpret content, and make decisions. Through systematic experimentation and empirical analysis, we explore the **interpretability gap** between what we can measure and what we can understand about LLM behavior.

### Key Research Questions
- How do different base models (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, Perplexity) handle brand mentions differently?
- What biases exist in pre-trained models and how do they affect content discovery?
- Why do the same queries produce different responses across models and even within the same model?
- How can brands optimize for AI discovery when AI behavior itself is unpredictable?

## 📊 Major Research Findings

### 1. The Interpretability Gap in LLM Behavior
**Key Insight**: While platforms build sophisticated tracking systems for Answer Engine Optimization (AEO), the same query asked by different people can yield entirely different LLM responses. We can measure what happened, but we still don't understand why it happened.

**Evidence**: [Interpretability Gap Analysis](research/interpretability-gap-llm-behavior.md)

### 2. ChatGPT's Optimization Illusion  
**Discovery**: ChatGPT's web search triggering is fundamentally inconsistent. Even with identical queries in incognito sessions, the same prompt can yield completely different behaviors - sometimes triggering web search, sometimes relying purely on training data.

**Implication**: Perfect content optimization may still yield zero visibility due to factors entirely outside brand control.

**Deep Dive**: [ChatGPT Optimization Illusion](research/optimization-illusion-ChatGPT.md)

### 3. Model-Specific Fine-tuning Creates Distinct "Personalities"
**Finding**: Each frontier lab (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Meta) uses different fine-tuning approaches, creating distinct content preferences:

- **ChatGPT**: Prefers structured lists, comparison tables, actionable content
- **Claude**: Favors reasoning chains, nuanced analysis, academic sources  
- **Gemini**: Emphasizes authority signals, citations, factual verification
- **Perplexity**: Prioritizes real-time content and source diversity

**Research**: [NLP Principles for Model Behavior & GEO Strategy](research/nlp-principles-model-behavior-geo.md)

### 4. The Semantic Monopoly Problem
**Observation**: Certain brands achieved deep semantic association during the model training period (2019-2024):
- "CRM" → HubSpot, Salesforce
- "Spreadsheet" → Excel  
- "Video conferencing" → Zoom

**Strategic Insight**: New brands cannot compete head-on with semantic monopolies but must find niche positioning.

### 5. Content Visibility Operates on Multiple Layers
**Framework**: Content must pass through six distinct filters to achieve AI visibility:
1. **Crawlability** - Technical accessibility
2. **Parsability** - Clear structure for AI extraction
3. **Relevance** - Query-content alignment
4. **Efficiency** - High semantic density for processing
5. **Confidence** - Authority signals and factual consistency
6. **Synthesis Priority** - Computational ROI for inclusion

## Research Methodology

### Daily Experimentation Protocol
**Process**: Systematic testing of query variations across multiple LLM platforms with consistent documentation in our [research logbook](logbook/observations/2025-llm-behavior-experiments.md).

**Testing Framework**:
- Same query tested across ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, Perplexity
- Multiple time periods to identify temporal patterns
- Incognito sessions to minimize personalization effects
- Documentation of response variations and synthesis patterns

### Behavioral Pattern Recognition
**Approach**: Rather than attempting to reverse-engineer black box algorithms, we focus on identifying observable behavioral constants and triggers across different models.

**Key Metrics**:
- **Appearance Rate**: Frequency of brand/content mentions
- **Synthesis Depth**: How thoroughly content is processed and integrated
- **Citation Position**: Placement within AI-generated responses
- **Sentiment Preservation**: Accuracy of message conveyance

## Key Theoretical Contributions

### 1. The Interpretability Gap Theory
**Hypothesis**: The gap between what we can measure and what we can understand in LLM behavior isn't a problem to solve—it's the reality to navigate.

**Supporting Evidence**: 
- Identical queries producing different responses
- Perfect content optimization yielding zero visibility
- Unpredictable web search triggering in ChatGPT

### 2. Semantic Positioning Strategy
**Framework**: Instead of competing with established semantic monopolies, new brands should focus on:
- **Industry-specific positioning**: "CRM for real estate agents"
- **Use-case optimization**: "CRM for solopreneurs under $1k/year"  
- **Problem-first discovery**: Content that intercepts user problems rather than category searches

### 3. The Multi-Modal Optimization Paradigm
**Prediction**: As LLMs evolve toward multi-modal capabilities, content optimization must expand beyond text to include:
- Voice query optimization
- Visual content for AI parsing
- Cross-modal semantic consistency
