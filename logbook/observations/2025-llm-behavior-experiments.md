- Claude schema crawl, web search query processing notes
- Llm.text file hypothesis
- GitHub crawling analysis - pretraining, fine tuning, web search activation

Key learning: We are not studying LLMs. We are actually trying to understand four different search engines that operating on completely different set of rules, fine tuning parameters and weights (base model).

## August 19, 2025 (Tuesday)

- Understanding internal routing, when schema gets triggered, when it relies on training data.
- Tried to deep dive and make sense of this, got context on when it decides to do what but there are so many factors at play including its own judgement of how well it knows "answer to the query" and server load among other things.
- Really cannot be controlled and hence can't be promised
- Have recorded my notes on schema and router in a separate file for future reference.
- Claude's web crawler and its decision to go web vs rely on training data

## August 18, 2025 (Monday)

NS updates:
- D2C demo to founder, agency buy in and coordination (automate sign up, credits, GA integration as next steps)
- Another reason to automation onboarding is to avoid agency bottleneck which wil lead to delay + lead leakage due to disengagement/lack of ownership.

My research: Query routing [optimization illusion of chatgpt](https://github.com/KK92-ai/llm-model-behavior-research/blob/main/research/optimization-illusion-ChatGPT.md)

- The GEO space is ripe for disruption but there's a narrow window (6-12 months) before big tech platforms integrate these capabilities natively. Focus on actionable insights (and agentic execution) rather than just monitoring might provide more sustainable value.
